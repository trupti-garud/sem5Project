            <i>A sari (sometimes also saree or sadi) is a women's garment from the Indian subcontinent. It consists of an un-stitched stretch of woven fabric arranged over the body as a robe, with one end attached to the waist, 
                while the other end rests over one shoulder as a stole,sometimes baring a part of the midriff. It may vary from 4.1 to 8.2 metres (4.5 to 9 yards) in length,
                 and 60 to 120 centimetres (24 to 47 inches) in breadth,
                 and is a form of ethnic wear in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. There are various names and styles of sari manufacture and draping, the most common being the Nivi style.[9][10] The sari is worn with a fitted bodice also called a choli (ravike or kuppasa in southern India, and cholo in Nepal) and a petticoat called ghagra, parkar, or ul-pavadai.[11] 
                It remains fashionable in the Indian subcontinent today.

                <i>The history of sari-like drapery can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, which flourished during 2800–1800 BCE 
                    around the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.Cotton was first cultivated and woven on the Indian subcontinent around the 5th millennium BCE.
                     Dyes used during this period are still in use, particularly indigo, lac, red madder and turmeric.
                    Silk was woven around 2450 BCE and 2000 BCE.</i>

                <i>It can take up to six weeks to make a pair of Kolhapuris.Originally made from buffalo-hide and thread, 
                    they weighed as much as 2.01 kilos because of the thickness of the sole, which made them durable 
                    despite the extreme heat and mountainous terrain found in the state of Maharashtra.
                    For making Kolhapuri Chappal various operations are done step by step like skiving, pattern making 
                    and cutting, attachment of upper and bottom heels, stitching, finishing, punching and Trimming, 
                    decoration and Polishing, and assembling.[citation needed] Kolhapuri chappals are known to last a lifetime if maintained well and not used in rainy seasons.
                    In 2020, the total business market was estimated at around ₹9 crore, with over 10,000 artisans working in Kolhapur. 
                    Of the total six lakh pairs produced annually, 30% were exported.The designs have moved from the ethnic to ones with more utilitarian value 
                    and materials from primal hard materials to softer and more comfortable to wear materials. The artisans themselves designed ethnic patterns and sold, but today the traders and 
                    businessmen with demand for cheap products drive the requirement of minimalist designs.[citation needed]
                    In recent decades, the business has struggled for survival with market decline, low profits, irregular leather supply, duplicates & fakes, environmental regulations on tanneries, cow slaughter ban, among other issues.</i>
